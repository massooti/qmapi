### Getting Started
Create and add rich question, quiz, question categories content using REST api inside your moodle LMS for free. Some examples of what you get with QMAPI are Interactive Quizzes, questions types and question categories.
# Why should use qmapi
Good question! I started unexpectedly developing for Moodle. Moodle, as you may have noticed, is very academic in all its aspects even code. So you may not find the specific answer to your question quickly. And that's why this project is worth sharing. This template is a result of reading all the documentation provided in Moodle Developer DOCs. Development of few production-ready plugins for large Moodle powered platforms. And finally, this is what I am using all the time to kick start any new plugin.
